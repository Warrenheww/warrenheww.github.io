Today marks a defining milestone in my life—I’ve officially earned my PhD.

### The Journey

I want to express my deepest gratitude to Prof. Serdal Kirmizialtin, whose guidance, support, and belief in my potential carried me through every challenge. Your mentorship shaped not only my research, but also how I think, solve problems, and grow as a scientist.

To my family—thank you for your unwavering love and encouragement. None of this would have been possible without you. Here's to new beginnings.
