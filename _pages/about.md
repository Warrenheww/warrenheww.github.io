## Biography

Hello! I am Lijie Hu, a final-year Ph.D. Candidate in Computer Science at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST) since Spring 2021. I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Di Wang](https://shao3wangdi.github.io/) in the [PRADA Lab](https://pradalab1.github.io/) (Provable Responsible AI and Data Analytics Lab). Before that, I received my Master's degree in Mathematics from Renmin University of China.

My research interests are **Explainable AI** and **Privacy-preserving Machine Learning**. Specifically, my research goals are to develop **Usable XAI-as-a-Service systems** and **Useful Explainable AI toolkits**. Here, *usable* refers to providing faithful model understanding services. *Useful* means the toolkit helps improve model performance and trustworthiness. My research advances these goals across four main directions:

- **Theoretical Foundations of Usable XAI:**  
  Topics include stability ([ICML'24 Spotlight](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=YdwwWRX20q), [ICLR'24](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=rp0EdI8X4e), [AAAI'23 Oral](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/26517)),  
  controllability ([ICML'25,a](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11667), [ArXiv2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15476)),  
  and consistency ([NeurIPS'24](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21494), [EMNLP'24,a](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.06606)).

- **Useful XAI in Large Models:**  
  Enhance safety ([AAAI'25 Oral,a](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/34710), [ICML'25,b](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06331)),  
  boost performance ([ArXiv](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=yrnrvfXFaV)),  
  steer behavior ([ArXiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.03595)).

- **System for XAI:**  
  Focused on interpretability acceleration.

- **XAI for Science:**  
  Applications in healthcare ([ICLR'24](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=rp0EdI8X4e), [NeurIPS'24](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21494)),  
  traffic, material science, and marine science.

## Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning

In this area, I mainly focus on **private statistical estimation** and its application to **natural language models**. Highlights include works published in:

- [JMLR,a](https://jmlr.org/papers/v24/21-0523.html), [JMLR,b](https://jmlr.org/papers/v25/22-0079.html)  
- [ECAI'23](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.13520), [AISTATS'23](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v206/hu23a/hu23a.pdf)  
- [TKDE](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10314000), [PODS'22](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3517804.3524144), [ALT'22](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v167/su22a/su22a.pdf)  
- [EMNLP'24 Oral,c](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08027), [EACL'24](https://aclanthology.org/2024.findings-eacl.33/)
