## Biography

Hello! I am **W. He**, a Postdoctoral Associate in Computational Biophysics and Theoretical Chemistry at **New York University Abu Dhabi**, affiliated with the **Chemistry Program** and the **Center for Smart Engineering Materials (CSEM)**. I work under the supervision of **Prof. Serdal Kirmizialtin**, with internal collaborations with **Prof. Panče Naumov**, and broader collaborations with:

- **Prof. Lois Pollack** (Nucleic Acids Biophysics, Cornell)
- **Prof. Mark E. Tuckerman** (Biomolecular Dynamics, NYU)
- **Profs. Ting Wang & Jia Sheng** (RNA Biology)
- **Profs. Xiangyun Qiu & George Shubeita** (Biopolymer Phase Transition)

My research integrates **molecular dynamics (MD) simulations**, **machine learning**, and **experimental data** to understand the **structure, dynamics, and interactions of nucleic acids (DNA/RNA)**. Key areas include:

- SAXS/WAXS-guided MD for RNA/DNA structure refinement  
- RNA force field development and validation  
- Phase behavior and condensation of DNA  
- Controllable RNA folding via chemical modifications  
- Multi-scale modeling of nucleic acid–vector assemblies for gene therapy

Previously, I earned a Ph.D. in **Biophysics** from **New York University** (2018–2023), including a research visit to **Cornell University** (2022), and completed my B.Sc. in **Chemistry** at **Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech)** in 2017.
