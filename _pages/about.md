My name is **Weiwei He**, currently a Postdoctoral Associate in Computational Biophysics and AI for Science at **New York University Abu Dhabi**, affiliated with the **Division of Science** and the **Chemistry Program** since Summer 2023, and I am very fortunate to be advised by **Prof. [Serdal Kirmizialtin](https://nyuad.nyu.edu/en/academics/divisions/science/faculty/serdal-kirmizialtin.html)** in the [**Kirmizialtin Lab**](https://www.kirmizialtinlab.org/). Before that, I received my Ph.D. in **Biophysics** from **New York University**, also under the guidance of Prof. Kirmizialtin, and earned my B.Sc. in **Chemistry** from **Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech)** with **Prof. [Xin-Yuan Liu (刘心元)](https://liuxy.chem.sustech.edu.cn/)**.

My research integrates **molecular dynamics (MD) simulations**, **machine learning**, and **enhanced sampling** to understand the **structure, dynamics, and interactions of nucleic acids (DNA/RNA)**. I focus on experimental data-driven MD for RNA/DNA structure determination and refinement, RNA force field optimization and development, DNA condensation and phase separation, RNA function control via chemical modifications, and multi-scale modeling of nucleic acid–vector assemblies for gene therapy. I collaborate internally with **Prof. [Panče Naumov](https://nyuad.nyu.edu/en/academics/divisions/science/faculty/pance-naumov.html)** at [**CSEM**](https://nyuad.nyu.edu/en/research/faculty-labs-and-projects/center-for-smart-engineering-materials.html) on biomaterials modeling, and more broadly with:

- **Prof. [Lois Pollack](https://pollack.research.engineering.cornell.edu/)** (Nucleic Acids Biophysics)
- **Profs. [Ting Wang](https://www.albany.edu/chemistry/wang-group) & [Jia Sheng](https://www.albany.edu/rna/sheng-lab)** (RNA Modifications and Photocontrol)
- **Profs. [Xiangyun Qiu](https://qiuresearch.github.io/) & [George Shubeita](https://nyuad.nyu.edu/en/academics/divisions/science/faculty/george-shubeita.html)** (Biopolymer Phase Transition)
- **Prof. [Mark E. Tuckerman](https://wp.nyu.edu/tuckerman_group/)** (Biomolecular Dynamics)
