## Probing Nucleic Acid Dynamics with Low-Resolution Data and Data-driven Simulations

Probing the dynamic structure of nucleic acids remains a fundamental challenge due to their conformational flexibility and the limitations of experimental resolution. While solution SAXS provides valuable global shape information, its low resolution makes it difficult to resolve structural details essential for mechanistic insights. I mainly focused on bridging this gap through the integratiion of SAXS with molecular simulations to achieve atomistic interpretations of DNA and RNA dynamics. I focus on three key areas: **structure refinement**, **conformational sampling**, and **experimental validation**. This approach has enabled the resolution of complex nucleic acid structures in solution and the discovery of new regulatory mechanisms in RNA biology.

## Refining RNA Force Fields with Experimental Integration

Accurately modeling RNA remains a major challenge due to its flexible backbone and complex energy landscape, which are often inadequately described by existing all-atom force fields. To address this, my research focuses on refining RNA force field parameters by integrating molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with experimental benchmarks from solution X-ray scattering (SAXS/WAXS) and FRET.

This hybrid approach has significantly improved the ability of MD to capture the structural and dynamic properties of flexible RNA elements, such as single-stranded and Helix-Junction-Helix (HJH) motifs. The refined force field demonstrates enhanced agreement with experimental observables and provides a more faithful representation of RNA behavior in solution.
