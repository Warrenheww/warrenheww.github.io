## Probing Nucleic Acid Dynamics with Low-Resolution Data and Data-driven Simulations

Probing the dynamic structure of nucleic acids remains a fundamental challenge due to their conformational flexibility and the limitations of experimental resolution. While solution SAXS provides valuable global shape information, its low resolution makes it difficult to resolve structural details essential for mechanistic insights. I mainly focused on bridging this gap through the integratiion of SAXS with molecular simulations to achieve atomistic interpretations of DNA and RNA dynamics. I focus on three key areas: **conformational sampling**, **ensemble refinement**, and **experimental validation**. This approach has enabled the resolution of complex nucleic acid structures in solution and the discovery of new regulatory mechanisms in RNA biology.

## Refining RNA Force Fields with Experimental Integration

Accurately modeling RNA remains a major challenge due to its flexible backbone and complex energy landscape, which are often inadequately described by existing emprical force fields. To address this, my research focuses on refining RNA force field parameters by integrating **MD simulations** with experimental benchmarks from **solution experiemnts**, such as SAXS/WAXS and FRET. I applied **machine learning** methods to analyze simulation deviations from experimental data, to identify imbalances in energy termsâ€”such as electrostatics and van der Waals interactions. This informed a targeted refinement strategy, resulting in a force field that significantly improves MD accuracy for flexible RNA motifs like single-stranded and Helix-Junction-Helix (HJH) structures. The refined model achieves enhanced agreement with experimental observables and provides a more faithful representation of RNA dynamics in solution.
