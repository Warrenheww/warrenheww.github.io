## Probing Nucleic Acid Dynamics with Low-Resolution Data and Data-driven Simulations

Probing the dynamic structure of nucleic acids remains a fundamental challenge due to their conformational flexibility and the limitations of experimental resolution. While solution SAXS provides valuable global shape information, its low resolution makes it difficult to resolve structural details essential for mechanistic insights. I mainly focused on bridging this gap through the integratiion of SAXS with molecular simulations to achieve atomistic interpretations of DNA and RNA dynamics. I focus on three key areas: **structure refinement**, **conformational sampling**, and **experimental validation**. This approach has enabled the resolution of complex nucleic acid structures in solution and the discovery of new regulatory mechanisms in RNA biology.

## Towards Useful XAI in Large Models

I also applied Useful XAI as a toolkit, serving as a guide for boosting utility and enhancing the trustworthiness of deep learning models. I mainly focus on the following three aspects via interpretability:

1. **Enhancing Trustworthiness**  
   Useful XAI enhances trustworthiness, which is essential for LLMs. I use interpretability to mitigate safety challenges in LLMs, such as hallucination, jailbreaking, privacy, and copyright infringement.

2. **Boosting Utility**  
   XAI boosts model performance. For instance, it can be used as a modality for aligning LLMs and Graph models, reducing time and costs by 100x. XAI also fine-tunes LLMs, enabling self-aware error identification and correction.

3. **Analyzing Models**  
   XAI serves as an analytical tool to reveal deeper behaviors of LLMs.

## Towards Usable XAI for Science

Usable XAI models are essential in AI applications for the sciences because they help researchers understand and trust the decisions made by complex models. Through interdisciplinary collaborations, I have deployed these technologies for impactful applications in:

- **Healthcare**
- **Traffic analysis**
- **Material science**
- **Marine science**
