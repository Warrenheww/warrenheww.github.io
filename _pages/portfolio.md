## Theoretical Foundations of Usable XAI

Several interpretation techniques have been developed to enhance the explainability of deep learning models. However, few of them have delved into a fundamental question: *Do we truly trust these explainers?* In other words, are these interpretable methods faithful to the underlying models? This problem hinders the practical application of XAI. Thus, a usable XAI should provide faithful interpretations.

My research mainly focuses on improving the explanation faithfulness of current methods from three aspects: **stability**, **controllability**, and **consistency**.

## Towards Useful XAI in Large Models

I also applied Useful XAI as a toolkit, serving as a guide for boosting utility and enhancing the trustworthiness of deep learning models. I mainly focus on the following three aspects via interpretability:

1. **Enhancing Trustworthiness**  
   Useful XAI enhances trustworthiness, which is essential for LLMs. I use interpretability to mitigate safety challenges in LLMs, such as hallucination, jailbreaking, privacy, and copyright infringement.

2. **Boosting Utility**  
   XAI boosts model performance. For instance, it can be used as a modality for aligning LLMs and Graph models, reducing time and costs by 100x. XAI also fine-tunes LLMs, enabling self-aware error identification and correction.

3. **Analyzing Models**  
   XAI serves as an analytical tool to reveal deeper behaviors of LLMs.

## Towards Usable XAI for Science

Usable XAI models are essential in AI applications for the sciences because they help researchers understand and trust the decisions made by complex models. Through interdisciplinary collaborations, I have deployed these technologies for impactful applications in:

- **Healthcare**
- **Traffic analysis**
- **Material science**
- **Marine science**
